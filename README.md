# Gekyll
Unlike the static site generator Jekyll, Gekyll uses Go and JSON to make an ultra-fast dynamic blog. Without relying on a database backend. 

## Installation
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/nmccrory/minimal-blog.git

```
```
~$ cd minimal-blog
~$ go build .
~$ ./minimal-blog

```
#### Overview
Blogs are saved in a folder as JSON objects which are then read, stored, and formatted by Go.
